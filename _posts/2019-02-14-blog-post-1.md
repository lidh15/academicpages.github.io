I'm not an Instagram person, and in fact I don't like traveling at all (at present).
But my parents drove me to a mountain nearby on Monday.
I took 20 pictures with a size of 43 MB in total and I think I should find a corner for them.
**So if you want to save some mobile data, just leave this post.**

The road to the mountain was not completed yet, thus it took us about one hour to take a detour.
And the map app showed us a deprecated route, which made the trip even more annoying.

###Introduction###

I took a picture for the introduction of the mountain, but unfortunately it seems that I deleted it somehow.
So I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWIFxP1ApiI) broadcast on CCTV10 one year ago (try [this](http://tv.cctv.com/2018/01/12/VIDEd7SP0OOtSaoHgJzVuLYu180112.shtml) if that one is blocked).
In short, it is a dead volcano, and we can walk around the crater whose perimeter is 2075m.
It is free to visitors, and everything you can see there is really simple: no ticketing, no conductor, even no toilet.

###Pictures###

So what can we see while walking around it?
At the first check point, we can see the parking lot back there which is not large.

Here we can also see a pile of volcanic stone.

The crater:

At the second check point:

At the third check point, there is a path down into the crater:

We didn't take that road, just kept walking to the peak point:

Now the crater is on the west, and we went there in the afternoon, so the camera was disturbed by the sun.

I had to shade the camera with hand.

Now we are at the peak!

There are lots of volcanoes nearby in fact, check this out:

There is a path down into the crater again:

Field under the volcano:

See the peak in the opposite:

And the starting point:

![crater 8](/images/20190214Fig14.jpg 'crater')

The deprecated road the map app showed:

The other direction (into the crater):

![deprecated road](/images/20190214Fig15.jpg 'deprecated road')

Now we are at the lowest point, which is a bridge over a river dried up:

The other direction (into the crater):

Finally, check the bridge at a higher place:

###Conclusion###

Nice trip, simple and short!
